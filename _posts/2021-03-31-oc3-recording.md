---

Earlier this month, Derek Miller was invited to present Veracruz at the [Open Confidential Computing Conference (OC3)](https://hopin.com/events/oc3-2021).
A recording of Derek's talk is now available, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6njKU9v1kEg&list=PLEhAl3D5WVvSKTp9jD6lV67zuFR8lUZVa&index=13).

We would like to thank the OC3 organizers for inviting us to present at what was a very interesting event!
