We are delighted to announce that the Veracruz project has been invited to present at the [Open Confidential Computing Conference (OC3)](https://hopin.com/events/oc3-2021) in early March.
Derek Miller will be speaking on behalf of the Veracruz development team.
We thank the organizers for their invite, and look forward to what looks to be an interesting meeting!
