Recently Dominic Mulligan and Derek Miller presented two talks on Veracruz.  Dominic's talk provided a general overview of the project, and was presented in the Hardware-aided Trusted Execution Environment Devroom at FOSDEM 2021.  Derek's talk, on the other hand, provided a more detailed look at how Veracruz handles remote attestation, and was presented at Linux Conf Australasia (LCA) 2021.  Recording of the talks are available [here](https://video.fosdem.org/2021/D.hardware.trusted/tee_veracruz.webm) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoI4NLmQTqE), respectively.
