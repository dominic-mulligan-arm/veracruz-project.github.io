title: Upcoming Veracruz talks
---

We are excited to announce two upcoming talks on the Veracruz project:

1. The first, by Derek Miller, is a talk entitled **Veracruz: privacy-preserving multi-party computation using trusted hardware** at Linux Conf Australasia (LCA).
This will be held on **Monday 25th January**, with a live question-and-answer session afterwards.
The abstract is [here](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/67/).
2. The second, by Dominic Mulligan, is a talk entitled **Veracruz: privacy-preserving collaborative compute** in the Hardware-aided Trusted Computing Devroom at FOSDEM 2021.
This will be held on **Saturday 6th February**, with a live question-and-answer session afterward.
The abstract is [here](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/tee_veracruz/).

Both LCA and FOSDEM are virtual events this year (with FOSDEM being free, with no registration required).  We hope to see you there!
