# Veracruz: an open-source project

Until recently, Veracruz was a research project developed internally by members of the Distributed Systems and Security team within Arm Research.
Yesterday, we open-sourced Veracruz, and will continue further development in the open.
See the [main Veracruz repository](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz) for more details on the project, and how to begin contributing!
